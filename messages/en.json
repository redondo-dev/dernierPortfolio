    "text": "As a passionate Full Stack Developer, I forged my expertise through 8 months of intensive training at AFPA, complemented by continuous self-learning. This dual approach has allowed me to develop a deep understanding of modern web technologies.\n\nMy front-end expertise spans the entire React ecosystem, including React.js, Redux, Redux Toolkit, as well as modern CSS frameworks like Material UI, React Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS. This mastery enables me to create elegant and performant user interfaces.\n\nOn the back-end, I've gained solid experience with PHP and SQL, and evolved towards Node.js, Express, and MongoDB technologies, embracing modern full JavaScript architectures. This versatility allows me to manage the entire technical stack of a project.\n\nConstantly evolving, I'm currently training on Next.js and React Native, with the ambition to become an expert Full Stack developer, capable of creating complete and innovative web and mobile applications.",
